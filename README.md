# ShuffleSim

Simulation of Riffle Shuffles (perfect riffle shuffles), visualized.

Code and results to simulate doing N riffle shuffles on a deck of 60 cards. Visualized as a 60x60 black image where the alpha channel represents the relative frequency of any individual result. A perfect equal distribution would be full black.

Code is lightly commented. See results at [https://prodigysim.github.io/shufflesim/](https://prodigysim.github.io/shufflesim/)
